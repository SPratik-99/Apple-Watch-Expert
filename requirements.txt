# All packages tested for compatibility and proper fallbacks

# Core Streamlit (always required)
streamlit>=1.28.0

# Essential web functionality
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.2
lxml>=4.9.0

# AI/ML - Groq API (lightweight, reliable)

# Note: This requirements.txt is designed for maximum compatibility
# All components have graceful fallbacks if optional packages fail to install
# The system will work in any of these modes:
# 1. Full mode: All packages installed
# 2. Groq mode: Only Groq + core packages
# 3. Expert mode: Only core packages (still fully functional)

# For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
# - Just add your GROQ_API_KEY in secrets
# - All packages install automatically
# - System detects capabilities and adapts

# Your app will NEVER crash due to missing dependencies!
