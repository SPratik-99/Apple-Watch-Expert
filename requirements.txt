# Apple Watch Expert - Updated Requirements for Production Deployment
# Handles optional dependencies gracefully

# Core Streamlit
streamlit>=1.28.0

# Essential dependencies (always required)
requests>=2.31.0
beautifulsoup4>=4.12.2
lxml>=4.9.0
pathlib>=1.0.1
typing-extensions>=4.7.0

# AI/ML Dependencies (with graceful fallbacks)
# Groq API (free, recommended for best performance)
groq>=0.4.1

# Optional: Hugging Face Transformers (CPU optimized)
torch>=2.0.0; platform_machine != "armv7l"
transformers>=4.30.0; platform_machine != "armv7l"

# Optional: Vector Database and Embeddings
chromadb>=0.4.15
sentence-transformers>=2.2.2

# Optional: Document Processing (PDF support)
PyPDF2>=3.0.1

# Data Processing
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Text Processing & NLP  
nltk>=3.8
regex>=2023.0.0

# Utilities
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.0.0

# Development & Debugging (minimal for production)
logging>=0.4.9.6

# Note: All dependencies are designed with graceful fallbacks
# The system works even if optional packages are not installed
# Core functionality: Expert responses, web scraping, budget analysis
# Enhanced functionality: AI models, document processing, embeddings

# For Streamlit Cloud deployment:
# - All dependencies install automatically
# - No manual configuration needed
# - System detects available features and adapts

# For local development:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# Optionally add: export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key" for enhanced AI

# Production deployment scenarios:
# 1. Minimal: Just core dependencies (still fully functional)  
# 2. Standard: Core + Groq API (recommended for recruiters)
# 3. Full: All dependencies (maximum capabilities)
